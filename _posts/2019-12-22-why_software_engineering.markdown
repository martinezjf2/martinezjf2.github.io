Vince Lombardi once wrote,

"We would accomplish many more things if we did not think of them as impossible."


One of the toughest questions that a teenager has to encounter throughout their “young-adult” journey to having careers is, “what do you want to be when you grow up.” During my senior year in high school, I really did not value school as much as I do now. One of the toughest challenges in high school was facing a deep depression. I am so grateful to god and for my family for the help that I have surpassed that depression, and because of that, I have accomplished many things within my life and have learned many lessons. Appreciate every day. Value the education that we have now, because there are other places that children would love to learn how to read books. Life will continue to move forward and so will we. Our future depends on us. 

One word that can describe why I chose this career: Relentless. I had an honor to be part of the Taco Bell family and was privileged to go to California on September 2018, to meet the CEO of TB, Mike Grams, and and Executive Leadership Coach, Justin Patton. He has many connections with NCAA, and many more companies talking about how to become a better leader today, than yesterday. Being able to go to his sessions has taught me that anyone can be a leader, For those who are thinking of achieving more than front end engineers, and going for Senior SW Engineers or even CEO’s of Facebook Inc. I believe that anyone can be a leader. At age 19, I have achieved the impossible to becoming one of the youngest restaurant managers within the nation in the Taco Bell industry. This was a huge accomplishment. I loved the job and inspired many people to achieve the impossible. But, I have always had in my mind that I wanted to be part of an impact or a change. Learning technology such as software engineering, and learning how to code, will lead me to have a balance with my family. It will help me be that impact in everyone’s lives. That is why I chose software engineer because I am relentless to moving forward and earning a great career.
